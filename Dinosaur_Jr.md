'''Dinosaur Jr.''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], in 1984. Originally called '''Dinosaur''', the band was forced to change their name due to [[#Name change|legal issues]].

The band was founded by [[J Mascis]] (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), [[Lou Barlow]] (bass, vocals), and [[Murph (drummer)|Murph]] (drums). After three albums on [[independent record label|independent labels]], the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dinosaur Jr. Rises from the Ashes — to Rock|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4812447|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=August 24, 2005|access-date=May 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Why Dinosaur Jr Still, And Always Will, Rule|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/why-dinosaur-jr-still-and-always-will-rule-47088|website=[[NME]]|date=June 22, 2009 |access-date=May 7, 2021}}</ref> Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed [[Sebadoh]] and [[Folk Implosion]].

The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Garland|first=Emma|author-link=|date=August 18, 2016|title=Rank Your Records: J Mascis Rates Dinosaur Jr. Albums from Bummer to Classic|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/3bdx8k/rank-your-records-dinosaur-jr-j-mascis/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201003212714/https://www.vice.com/en/article/3bdx8k/rank-your-records-dinosaur-jr-j-mascis |access-date=February 18, 2022|website=Noisey, Music by Vice Magazine|publisher=Vice Media Group (http://www.vice.com)|archive-date=October 3, 2020 }}</ref>

Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s [[classic rock]] and characterized by extensive use of [[audio feedback|feedback]] and [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.<ref name="Azerrad 2001, p. 357">Azerrad (2001), p. 357.</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
Mascis and Barlow played together, on drums and guitar respectively, in the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Deep Wound]], formed in 1982 while the pair were attending high school in western [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.spin.com/2012/10/dinosaur-jr-rediscovering-the-gnarl/|title = Dinosaur Jr.: Rediscovering the Gnarl|date = October 4, 2012|website = Spin|last = Bevan|first = David}}</ref> After high school, they began exploring slower yet still aggressive music like [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]], and [[Neil Young]]. Mascis's college friend [[Gerard Cosloy]] introduced him to psychedelic-influenced pop bands like [[Dream Syndicate]], which Mascis in turn showed to Barlow. Barlow explained, "We loved [[speed metal]]&nbsp;... and we loved wimpy-[[jangle pop|jangly]] stuff".<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 350</ref>

Deep Wound broke up in mid-1984. Cosloy had dropped out of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to focus on running his independent record label, [[Homestead Records]]. He promised Mascis that if he were to make a record, Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow described the songs as "...fucking brilliant...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really into my own little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama."{{cn|date=January 2024}} Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy (otherwise known as Murph) to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as "ear-bleeding country."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 351.</ref>

The band was initially named Mogo, and they played their first show on the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus in the first week of September 1984. However, Nakajima used the performance to launch an extended anti-police tirade. Mascis was so appalled by Nakajima's behavior at the show that he disbanded the group the next day. A few days later, Mascis invited Barlow and Murph to form a new band without telling Nakajima. "I was kind of like too wimpy to kick him out, exactly," Mascis later admitted. "Communicating with people has been a constant problem in the band." The trio named themselves Dinosaur, and Mascis and Barlow took over lead vocal duties.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 352.</ref>

===''Dinosaur''===
Mascis took Cosloy up on his offer to release an album on Homestead, and Dinosaur recorded their debut album for $500 at a home studio in the woods outside [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].<ref name="Azerrad 353">Azerrad (2001), p. 353.</ref> Their debut album ''[[Dinosaur (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Dinosaur]]'' was released in 1985, for which Mascis wrote all of the songs. The vocals were done by Mascis in his trademark nasal drawl, which was often compared to singer Neil Young.<ref name="Azerrad 354"/> Mascis would sing most or all of the lead vocals on all of their subsequent releases. The album did not make much of an impact commercially or critically. It sold only about 1,500 copies in its first year and was largely ignored by the majority of the music press.<ref name="Azerrad 354">Azerrad (2001), p. 354.</ref>

After the record's release, Dinosaur would often drive to New York City to perform shows. The New York-based alternative rock band [[Sonic Youth]] was unimpressed by the first Dinosaur performance they saw, but after watching them play several months later, they approached the band declaring themselves fans.<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 354–355.</ref> Sonic Youth invited Dinosaur to join them on tour in the American Northeast and northern Midwest in September 1986.

===''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}''===
Dinosaur recorded much of their second album, ''[[{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}]]'', with Sonic Youth engineer [[Wharton Tiers]] in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph due to Mascis' very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, "J controlled Murph's every drumbeat&nbsp;... And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 356.</ref> Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based [[SST Records]]. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, which Cosloy felt betrayed by, "There was ''no way'' I couldn't take it personally."<ref name="Azerrad 2001, p. 357"/> After the album's completion, Mascis moved to New York, leaving the rest of the band feeling alienated.<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 358–359.</ref>

''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}'' was released in 1987; early copies of the record in the Boston area were packaged with the ''[[Weed Forestin']]''  tape, the first release by Barlow's side project [[Sebadoh]]. The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. Barlow also composed two songs: the hardcore-influenced "Lose" and an acoustic song entitled "Poledo" that anticipated his work with [[Sebadoh]].

=== Name change ===
Immediately following the release of ''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}'', a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called [[Dinosaurs (band)|Dinosaurs]] (featuring ex-members of [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Hot Tuna]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]]) sued Dinosaur over the use of the name, prompting the addition of "Jr."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Van Evra|first=Jennifer|date=May 23, 2007|title=When Dinosaur rocked the Earth|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/when-dinosaur-rocked-the-earth/article686130/|access-date=June 22, 2020|website=The Globe and Mail}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wright |first=William J. |title=The Real Reason These Bands Were Forced To Change Their Names |url=https://www.grunge.com/284134/the-real-reason-these-bands-were-forced-to-change-their-names/ |website=Grunge |access-date=7 April 2022 |date=24 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cease, Desist and Rock Out with a Different Band Name |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/cease-desist-and-rock-out-with-a-different-band-na/ |access-date=7 April 2022 |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=30 March 2015}}</ref>

===''Bug'' and Barlow's departure===
Dinosaur Jr. had a significant breakthrough in the United Kingdom with their debut single for ''[[Blast First]]'', "[[Freak Scene]]", in 1988.<ref>Strong, Martin C. (2002), "The Great Rock Discography, 6th edn.", Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-312-1}}.</ref> A version with censored lyrics was issued for radio use, reaching number 4 in the UK independent chart. It stayed on the chart for 12 weeks.<ref name="Lazell">Lazell, Barry: "Indie Hits 1980–1989", 1997, Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}.</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Bug]]'', followed shortly afterwards, reaching number 1 on the UK independent chart and spending 38 weeks on the chart.<ref name="Lazell" /> The band's first [[UK singles chart]] placing came in 1989 with their cover of [[The Cure|The Cure's]] "[[Just Like Heaven (The Cure song)|Just Like Heaven]]".

''Bug'' was similar in musical style to ''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}'', with contrasting distorted instruments and the melodic vocals, as was the band's unique blend of musical influences. However, ''Bug'' was considered to be more melodic, accompanied by more conventional song structures. Mascis exhibited even tighter control over the band's sound, singing lead vocals on all but one song and composing the parts for Murph and Lou to play. Barlow's only lead vocal was on the album's final track, featuring an overdriven, noise-rock backing track and Barlow screaming "Why don't you like me?".{{cn|date=January 2024}}

Mascis has described ''Bug'' as his least favorite of the band's albums, saying in a 2005 interview "''Bug'' is my least favourite of all our records. I like some of the songs but, I dunno, I guess I really don't like the vibe of it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/3592/Interviews/Dinosaur-Jr--Interview|title=Dinosaur Jr – Interview|website=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref>

Despite the album's success, tension between Mascis and Barlow began interfering with the band's productivity. In 1989, after touring in support of ''Bug'', Barlow was kicked out of the band. Barlow focused his attention on his former side-project [[Sebadoh]]. "The Freed Pig", the opening track on 1991's ''[[Sebadoh III]]'', documents Barlow's frustration with Mascis and feeling of being treated poorly in Dinosaur Jr.

Meanwhile, the band embarked on an Australian tour with [[Donna Dresch]] filling in for Barlow. In 1990, the band released a new single,"[[The Wagon]]", on [[Sub Pop]], their first release since Barlow's departure. The single featured a short-lived lineup including guitarist [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] and drummer Jay Spiegel from the band [[Gumball (band)|Gumball]], in addition to Mascis and Murph.

===Major label years===
Despite the ongoing turmoil in their lineup, Dinosaur Jr. signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1990, and made their major-label debut with ''[[Green Mind]]'' in 1991.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Kay|first=Graeme|date=5 March 1991|title=Green Mind review|journal=Q Magazine|volume=55|pages=68}}</ref> This record heavily featured Mascis, with Murph playing drums on only a few songs, as well as minimal contributions from Fleming and Spiegel, who were out of the band by the time the album was released. Mascis recorded many of the drum parts by himself and layered the various instrumental parts through [[overdubbing]].<ref name=":0" />

For touring purposes, Mascis first added [[Van Conner]], and then [[Mike Johnson (bassist)|Mike Johnson]] on bass. Together they embarked on several tours to support ''Green Mind'', with support acts that included [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. In 1991, Sire Records released an EP titled ''[[Whatever's Cool with Me]]'' that featured old B-sides coupled with one new track. In 1992, the band was part of the [[Rollercoaster Tour]], a package tour based on the successful [[Lollapolooza]] festival, which featured [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

The band found their live shows well received in the changing musical climate of the early 1990s and decided to record new material with the new lineup. This time, the recording sessions included full participation from Murph and Johnson, with the former playing most of the drums and the latter playing all of the bass parts, singing harmony vocals, and even contributing a few guitar solos.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} This material represented the peak of the band's commercial success, with the single ''[[Start Choppin]]''' reaching the top 20 in the UK, and the album that followed, ''[[Where You Been]]'', reaching the UK top 10 and the US top 50. The opening track, ''[[Out There (Dinosaur Jr. song)|Out There]]'', had an accompanying video and was aired on [[MTV]] for a short time on the show ''[[120 Minutes]]''. Although their new material was more accessible than the band's 1980s albums, in terms of playing, it represented a partial return to the more unrestrained power-trio sound of the original lineup.

Murph left the band after touring for ''Where You Been'' and was replaced for the band's live shows by George Berz, leaving Mascis as the sole remaining original member. However, the band's subsequent albums would be recorded mostly by Mascis on his own, playing everything except for the bass and some of the harmony vocals, which continued to be handled by Mike Johnson. The commercial success continued with 1994's ''[[Without a Sound]]'', which placed well in both the US and UK album charts. After 1997's ''[[Hand It Over]]'', Mascis finally retired the Dinosaur Jr. name, with the group's final live performance being an appearance on the American talk show ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch Five Essential Dinosaur Jr. Clips |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=September 20, 2002 |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/47822-watch-five-essential-dinosaur-jr-clips/ |access-date=September 22, 2010 |first=Evan |last=Minsker}}</ref> In 2000, Mascis released the first of two solo albums under the name [[J Mascis + The Fog]].

===2005 reunion and onward===
Mascis and Barlow began to reconcile when Mascis began showing up at [[Sebadoh]] shows. "I think he was kind of aware of how much shit I was talking about him," Barlow noted in a 2005 interview, "but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/article/dinosaur-jr-13943|title=Onion AV Club Interview|access-date=February 16, 2017|publisher=The Onion|last=Hawthorne, Marc|date=July 20, 2005 }}</ref>

In 2002, the two shared the stage for two shows in London, with Barlow singing ''[[I Wanna Be Your Dog]]'' along with Mascis, [[Ron Asheton]], [[Scott Asheton]] and [[Mike Watt]], who had been performing [[The Stooges|Stooges]] songs as "Asheton, Asheton, Mascis and Watt".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,860030,00.html|title=Hell For Leather|access-date=April 15, 2008|newspaper=The Observer|last=Empire, Kitty | location=London|date=December 15, 2002|author-link=Kitty Empire}}</ref>

Mascis regained the master rights to the band's first three albums from SST in 2004 and arranged for their reissue on [[Merge Records|Merge]] in early 2005. Later that year, he and Barlow shared the stage at a benefit show for [[autism]] at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] organized by Barlow's mother, and played together as [[Deep Wound]] after Mascis and Sebadoh had completed their respective sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/15/dinosaur_jr_is_happy_to_be_no_longer_extinct|title=Dinosaur Jr. is happy to be no longer extinct|access-date=April 14, 2008|work=The Boston Globe|last=Anderman, Joan| date=July 15, 2005}}</ref>

Following the reissues in 2005, Mascis, Barlow, and Murph finally reunited to play on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on April 15, 2005. In June that year, they kicked off a tour of Europe. While performing in New York City in 2006, much of the band's equipment was stolen while stored outside their hotel.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nme.com/news/dinosaur-jr/24158|title=Dinosaur Jr's gear stolen mid-tour|access-date=April 14, 2008|magazine=NME}}</ref> The band members were later among the curators of 2006's [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival.

In 2007, the original members of Dinosaur Jr. released ''[[Beyond (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Beyond]]'' on [[Fat Possum Records]], their first album of new material as a trio since ''Bug'' in 1988. It was met with critical acclaim, receiving an 8.4 rating from [[Pitchfork Media]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/ |title=Dinosaur Jr. – Beyond |access-date=April 14, 2008|publisher=Pitchfork Media|last=Baron, Zach}}</ref> and garnering positive reviews from the music press as a whole. It was considered somewhat of a sonic paradox in that even though it featured the original members who produced "two records so drenched in noise they still sound like aural assaults decades after their original release," sonically it resembled the major label releases of the 1990s in both production values and stylistic range.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=beyond-mw0000568152|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dinosaur Jr. – Beyond|access-date=April 14, 2008|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}</ref> On the other hand, while the sound was not as extreme as the original lineup's 1980s albums, it did feature a bigger, more unrestrained, and more live-sounding feel than their 1990s albums, though Barlow's bass was noticeably quieter. Barlow made his mark on the music in other ways; for the first time since ''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}'', he contributed to the songwriting. The album went on to have good commercial success, debuting on the ''Billboard'' 200 at number 69 its opening week.

In February 2009, the band signed with indie label [[Jagjaguwar]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Thiessen |first=Brock |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid2=844&fid1=36786&csid1=0 |title=Dinosaur Jr. Sign to Jagjaguwar |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |date=February 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709164759/http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid2=844&fid1=36786&csid1=0 |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |access-date=January 10, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band's first release on the new label was an album titled ''[[Farm (album)|Farm]]'' which was released on June 23, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/34896-new-dinosaur-jr-lp-details/ |title=New Dinosaur Jr. LP Details Announced |access-date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=Pitchfork Media|last=Dombal, Ryan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103003919/http://pitchfork.com/news/34896-new-dinosaur-jr-lp-details/ |archive-date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> Murph said the album was recorded at Mascis's home and marks return to the heavier, ''Where You Been'' LP era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/citypulse/cqG9Wrj2laG55t1O/?article=275838|title=Digging Up Dinosaur Jr.|access-date=October 1, 2009|publisher=CityPulse|last=Tupica, Rich}}</ref> The album reached number 29 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it the band's highest-charting album in the US.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/dinosaur-jr/chart-history/tlp/|title=Dinosaur Jr. – Chart history (Billboard 200)|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 4, 2021}}</ref> To promote the album, the band played ''<nowiki>Farm'</nowiki>''s lead-off track, "Pieces", on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on June 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/band-bench/|title=Late Night Band Bench|access-date=June 18, 2009|publisher=NBC}}</ref>

In February 2019, the song "Over Your Shoulder" from the band's 1994 album ''Without a Sound'' reached number 18 on Japan's ''Billboard'' charts.

Dinosaur Jr. is considered to be an alternative rock band; however, the band's musical style, compared to its underground contemporaries in the 1980s, differed in several ways. This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume as well as loud-quiet dynamic, combined with Mascis's droning vocals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/citypulse#c-275838 |title=CityPulse by Wehaa |publisher=Npaper-wehaa.com |access-date=July 1, 2011 |archive-date=July 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715153818/https://npaper-wehaa.com/citypulse/#c-275838 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A characteristic of Mascis's vocal style is frequent use of [[vocal fry]]. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarized the band's music: "It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly pop, it wasn't exactly punk rock—it was completely its own thing".<ref name="Azerrad 353" />

Mascis listened to [[classic rock]] artists such as [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Beach Boys]], elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 348.</ref> In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], and has frequently noted [[Nick Cave]] as an influence. Dinosaur Jr. combined elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise rock]] into their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume.<ref name="auto"/> When the master tape of ''[[{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}]]'' arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 361.</ref>

Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as [[Lemmy]] and [[Johnny Ramone]]. On his influences, Barlow stated that "...Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/lou-barlow-jurassic/jul-05/11352|title=Lou Barlow Jurassic Rock|access-date=April 15, 2008|publisher=Bassplayer.com|last=Olwell, Greg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210832/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/lou-barlow-jurassic/jul-05/11352|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/music/features/feature_1118721694 |title=Bulbs, Bugs and Little Fury Things: Revisiting Dinosaur Jr |access-date=April 15, 2008 |publisher=Staticmultimedia.com |last=Bergrand, Adrian |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820115451/http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/music/features/feature_1118721694 |archive-date=August 20, 2008}}</ref>

Mascis's vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.'s music. He attributed his "whiny low-key drawl", the opposite of the hardcore punk "bark",<ref name="Azerrad 353" /> to artists such as [[John Fogerty]] and [[Mick Jagger]].<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 353–354.</ref> His style also resembled Neil Young's, but Mascis disputed this and later commented: "That got annoying, being compared all the time."<ref name="Azerrad 354" /> His drawl epitomized the band's slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author [[Michael Azerrad]] said "even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 346.</ref>

In a [[BBC]] review of their reissued albums ''{{proper name|You're Living All Over Me}}'' and ''Bug'', Zoe Street called them "Frighteningly ahead of their time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Street|first=Zoe|title= Dinosaur Jr. Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me, Bug Review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/98bd/|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' called them "one of [[post-punk]]’s most influential bands."<ref>{{cite web|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Influential Dinosaur Jr. reunites, releases first album in 20 years |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/influential-dinosaur-jr-reunites-releases-first-album-in-20-years/|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=June 13, 2007|access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> According to [[Michael Azerrad]]:<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 345.</ref><blockquote>Dinosaur Jr was one of the first, biggest, and best bands among the second generation of indie kids, the ones who took [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Minor Threat]] for granted, a generation for whom the Seventies, not the Sixties, was the nostalgic ideal. Their music continued a retrograde stylistic shift in the American underground that the Replacements and other bands had begun: renouncing the antihistorical tendencies of hardcore and fully embracing the music that everyone had grown up on. In particular, Dinosaur singer-guitarist J Mascis achieved the unthinkable in [[underground rock]]—he brought back the extended [[guitar solo]].</blockquote>Dinosaur Jr's music has influenced many other musicians such as [[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],<ref name="Attfield 2011, p. 30">Attfield (2011), p. 30</ref> [[Billy Corgan]] of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-08-11|title=Billy Corgan Reveals Greatest 90's Grunge Band|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/billy-corgan-reveals-greatest-90s-grunge-band/|access-date=2021-11-25|website=AlternativeNation.net|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Black Francis]] of [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Black: "When I get asked about Nirvana, I think, 'Am I being validated because some other dude mentioned my name?'
